# HTML_Webpage
My first attempt to create a webpage using HTML.

This project is an HTML webpage about a topic I selected at random from a list of potential options. It’s a small webpage, only three paragraphs, but it was done with the intention of helping me learn and understand basic HTML. In regards to the actual contents of the page, it is a brief overview of the Dodo, the now extinct flightless bird.

This project was incredibly useful to me, as I needed to learn basic HTML to help myself and others with another project. It helped me to understand the basic concepts of HTML and how to present my research in a more appealing and professional manner.

<p style="text-align: center; font-family:'Courier New'; color: #e0e3da">The Dodo (<i>Raphus cucullatus</i>), is a now-extinct flightless bird native to an island located in the Indian Ocean. The Dodo was larger than the average Turkey, weighing in at roughly 23kg, although it is impossible to know its true proportions. It was noted by its discoverers to have little fear of humans. The bird was first mentioned in 1598 by Dutch sailors who had sailed to the island of Mauritius.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%; color: #e0e3da">Why Did The Dodo Go Extinct?</h2>

<p2 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Courier New'; color: #e0e3da">The Dodo got its name from the Portuguese word “doudo”, roughly translated to “simpleton”, because of its very curious and friendly nature. Its curiosity made it an easy target for Dutch hunters. It is widely accepted that the Dodo went extinct as a result of excessive sport hunting and by the destruction of their habitat for resources. The last confirmed report of a dodo bird sighting was in 1662, but it has been theorized that the bird didn’t go extinct until closer to 1690.</p2>
  
<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%; color: #e0e3da">Why Is The Dodo Still an Important Topic?</h3>
<p3 style="font-family:'Courier New'; color: #e0e3da">The reason why the Dodo Bird (and its extinct relatives) are still a relevant topic is because of recent endeavors to bring the species back from extinction. New genetic technology has reportedly been promising, and many scientists have expressed an interest in bringing this bird back from the dead. The bird represents the future of genetic sciences.</p3>
