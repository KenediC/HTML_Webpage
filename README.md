# HTML_Webpage
My first attempt to create a webpage using HTML.

This project is an HTML webpage about a topic I selected at random from a list of potential options. Itâ€™s a small webpage, only three paragraphs, but it was done with the intention of helping me learn and understand basic HTML. In regards to the actual contents of the page, it is a brief overview of the Dodo, the now extinct flightless bird.

This project was incredibly useful to me, as I needed to learn basic HTML to help myself and others with another project. It helped me to understand the basic concepts of HTML and how to present my research in a more appealing and professional manner.
